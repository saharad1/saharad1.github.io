Hey there! I'm Sahar, currently a PhD Candidate at the [Technion – Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il) in collaboration with [Nvidia Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/) under the supervision of Prof. Ofra Amir and Dr. Assaf Hallak. My research centers on the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models, with a focus on how these fields inform each other and enable more capable and transparent decision making systems.

I study how LLMs can interpret and explain RL agents and how they can strengthen policy learning and planning. I also explore how RL methods can support more interpretable language models and more reliable finetuning strategies. I aim to bridge theoretical insights with practical algorithms that contribute to progress in both RL and NLP.

I truly enjoy talking about research, sharing ideas, and exploring ambitious directions together. If you are curious about my work or want to exchange thoughts about new possibilities, I would be glad to connect. Feel free to reach out!
